The Commission's Board consists of nine members, eight of whom are unsalaried Commissioners. The salaried Chair/Commissioner presides over regularly scheduled public Commission meetings, and is the head of the agency, which maintains a staff of approximately 600 TLC employees assigned to various divisions and bureaus.

The TLC licenses and regulates over 50,000 vehicles and approximately 100,000 drivers, and performs safety and emissions inspections of the 13,587 medallion taxicabs three times each year, as well as biennial inspections of all TLC-licensed For-Hire vehicles, making it the most active taxi and limousine licensing regulatory agency in the United States. To find out more about the TLC, or to review the agency's procedures, rules and regulations and programs, you may review the constantly updated information available throughout this web site, or you may visit 311 Online.</p></div>

<div id="tabr12" class="tab-content"><p>The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) today hosted
its fifth annual Vision Zero Safety Honor Roll ceremony to celebrate the
achievements of more than 400 of the city’s safest TLC-licensed drivers.
While drivers were at the center of this celebration of safety, the TLC also
recognized the contribution of taxi fleets and for-hire vehicle bases to the
City’s goal of Vision Zero. Once again, the TLC also honored drivers and
businesses that have made significant contributions to the TLC’s
Accessible Dispatch Program, which greatly expanded its service area to
encompass citywide pickups this year. The agency also recognized
drivers that have placed customer service at the forefront of their work.</p>

<div id="tabr22" class="tab-content"><p>The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) announced
publication of its 2018 Factbook today, giving insight into an industry that has
undergone significant change in recent years. The TLC collects and publicly
shares a wealth of data about taxis and for-hire vehicles in New York City, on
a scale that is unprecedented anywhere else in the world. This data, as well
as the TLC’s close engagement with stakeholders, helps the agency create
smart policy that ensures professional, safe and accessible service.
The Factbook provides a range of facts, from trip trends to lost
property, the number of wheelchair accessible vehicles, and the number of
electronically-requested taxi trips. For the first time, it also includes facts
about shared rides, after this data in the for-hire vehicle sector became
available last year. The data also illustrates the international diversity of
professional drivers in New York City.</p></div>
<div id="tabr32" class="tab-content"><p>The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is pleased to
announce that medallion taxicab drivers will now earn an extra $1 for any
trip provided in a wheelchair-accessible (yellow taxi) vehicle (WAV). This
increase doubles the $.50 per trip that drivers had earned. Passengers will
continue to pay the same 30-cent Taxi Improvement Fund (TIF) surcharge
on all metered rides.
“Professional drivers play a tremendous role in making New York City more
accessible and equitable to passengers with disabilities,” said
Commissioner Meera Joshi. “This will give hardworking TLC licensees
greater financial resources as they provide this vital service to the riding
public.</p></div>
<div id="tabr42" class="tab-content"><p>The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) today officially launched
its expanded Accessible Dispatch program, offering passengers a convenient,
user-friendly way to request a wheelchair-accessible taxicab throughout the five
boroughs. The program, which had been limited to pick-ups in Manhattan, fulfills
the TLC’s promised expansion of the popular program’s pick-up service area. The
new service debuted with a press conference at Brooklyn’s Borough Hall,
highlighting its borough-centric coverage area. Speakers included TLC
Commissioner and Chair Meera Joshi, and Mayor’s Office for People with
Disabilities (MOPD) Commissioner Victor Calise.</p></div></div>
